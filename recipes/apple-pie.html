        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to use the pre-made pie crust. You can find this at any grocery store in the refridgerated section.</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 6 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (6 medium) </li>
            <li>3/4 cup sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour </li>
            <li> 3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon </li>
            <li> 1/4 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li> 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg </li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon lemon juice </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 425Â°F. Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate. Press firmly against side and bottom. </li>
            <li>In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate. Top with second crust. Wrap excess top crust under bottom crust edge, pressing edges together to seal; flute. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust. </li>
            <li>Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until apples are tender and crust is golden brown. Cover edge of crust with 2- to 3-inch wide strips of foil after first 15 to 20 minutes of baking to prevent excessive browning. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving. </li>
            
        </ol>
