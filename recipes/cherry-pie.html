        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Easy 4 ingredient cherry pie that will still taste just the way grandma made it.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to use the pre-made pie crust. You will need 2. You can find this at any grocery store in the refridgerated section.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 cans (21 oz each) cherry pie filling </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon milk </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon sugar </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 425Â°F. Make pie crusts as directed on box for Two-Crust Pie, using 9-inch glass pie plate. </li>
            <li>Spoon pie filling into crust-lined plate. Top with second crust; seal edge and flute. Brush top crust with milk; sprinkle with sugar. Cut slits in several places on top crust. </li>
            <li>Bake 40 to 45 minutes or until crust is golden brown. After 15 to 20 minutes of baking, cover crust edge with strips of foil to prevent excessive browning. Cool at least 1 hour before serving. </li>
        </ol>
